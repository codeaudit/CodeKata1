NOVA Python's First Code Kata
=============================
This is the respository containing problem sets and general information
about our first Code Kata. This event will focus on using the `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_
module to help solve problems that you may want to use list iteration to
solve. We intend to make you more comfortable with the Numpy library, and
push your abilities to be able to use the library in your everyday work
(where applicable of course!).

Getting Started
---------------
Please browse through the problems to get an understanding of how they are structured. You can
start with our first problem, `FirstProblem <https://github.com/novapython/CodeKata1/FirstProblem>`_
, to get an understanding of how the problem sets
are laid out.
